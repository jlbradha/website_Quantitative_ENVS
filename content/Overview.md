## Course Catalog Description
Students will develop quantitative and environmental literacy by analyzing real-world environmental situations and problems with the use of mathematics and statistics. Students will learn how to use dynamic systems models and geographical information systems to gain insight into natural and social processes relevant to environmental issues and policy decisions. Prerequisites include: ENVS 101 with a minimum grade of D and MATH 181 with a minimum grade of D.


## Course Overview
Welcome to Quantitative Methods in Environmental Studies and Science! During this course we will explore common statistical approaches to understanding pressing environmental issues. This will include an introduction to both frequentist and Bayesian statistics as well as a brief dive into the the world of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to better understand spatial data. 



## Course Objectives

After successfully participation in this course, students should be able to:

* Conduct descriptive and inferrential statistical analysis using 

* Be familiar with the basic concepts of Bayesian statistics and their relationship to frequentist statistics

* Critically evaluate scientific literature

* Collect, analyze, and draw conclusions with data using the R and ArcGIS softwares




#### Computing Software
Throughout this course, we will be using the [R computer language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview), both of which will be made available to you through computers in the lab classroom. R is a free computer language software and can be loaded onto your computer if you prefer to work at home. ArcGIS is a *not* free and therefore you will need to use the lab computers for ArcGIS assignments. If you're interested, [*QGIS*](https://qgis.org/en/site/) *IS* a free and open source geographic information system (as is R!) that you can use on your personal laptop. However, because ArcGIS is still the leading software used in industry, we will conduct our analyses using that software.

Do not worry if you have never used (or heard of!) R or Geographical Information Systems. We will start at the very beginning you will be supported throughout the entire course with plenty of resources. 

#### Labs

This course will be hands on with a lot of 'doing' and a lot of computation. It is **completely normal** to be frustrated with coding and I am always here to help! Also, please see the [resources tab]() for additional helpful resources. 

While many of our labs will be analytical-based and located in the computer classroom, room ### in the xxx building ([campus map](https://www.wofford.edu/Wofford.edu/Documents/About/campusMapApril19.pdf)), some labs will also be held at Glendale where we will collect primary data. For these labs, please be sure to dress appropriately and bring necessary supplies. This includes (but is not limited to):

* hiking boots or outdoor walking shoes (no flip-flops!)

* Outdoor, weather-appropriate clothing

* water

* sunscreen

* snacks (granola bar, etc...not a 4-course meal)

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites include one of the following: 

*If you do not have one of these prerequisites, please come see me! I am happy to make exceptions, when appropriate, for students without an environmental science background*.  



## Grading

The grade breakdown for the course is as follows:

|                       |       |      |
|:---------------------:|------:|-----:|
| Class Participation & Homework    | 20%   |      |
| Lab Exercises                     | 20%   |      |
| Exams                             | 20%   |      |
| Final Project                     | 20%   |      |
| Final Exam                        | 20%   |      |


****Late assignments** will be penalized 10% for each day they are late, up to five days. After 5 days, the assignment penalty will remain at 50%.

## Attendance

While we could have an entire major dedicated to quantitative methods and models in environmental studies, we are, *alas*, relegated to only one very short semester. Because we have so many exciting things to learn, please make every effort to arrive to class on time and prepared. Excessive tardies will negatively affect your participation grade. 

Attendance is required at every class. There are no make-up assignments for missing class or lab. However, you are still responsible for knowing the material come exam time. Understandably, emergencies do arise and related absences will be excused with written, verifiable documentation provided for legitimate emergencies (e.g. representing Wofford in an official capacity, family emergency, accident, etc). In these circumstances, please let me know as early as possible that you will be missing class.



## Academic Honesty

The Honor Code is an important institution at Wofford College. Everyone is expected to follow both the letter and the spirit of the code and students violating this code will be reported to the university’s honor council. Examples of code violations include but are not limited to: cheating on exams, plagiarism, failure to report known violations, and falsification of class records. Further, not knowing how to reference a source is not an excuse. That means that wording, paraphrasing, or word for word copying without giving the original source credit are all violations. Anything you submit should reflect your own ideas with proper citations for any material you got from other sources—be it a book, a person, or a webpage. 

Last, I will be explicit throughout the year in letting you know what assignments are to be done individually and which assignments are collaborative. If at any time you have questions regarding citations or are unclear whether the assignment is to be done individually, please ask. 

More information on the Wofford College Honor Code can be found [here](https://www.wofford.edu/Wofford.edu/Documents/development/Honor%20Code_RightsResp.pdf).


## Accommodations

Every student learns differently and when possible, I am happy to work with students to meet their individual needs. Please see me or email me if you require special accommodations due to documented learning disabilities, physical requirements, medical needs, or any other reasons. I want every student to be successful in this course and am happy to make accommodations when appropriate. Below are some important resources you may find useful:
