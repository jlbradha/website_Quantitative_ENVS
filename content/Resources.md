# Software Tools for the Course

### R 
We will be using the R language throughout this course. As per the description on the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/about.html): 

>*R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics [...] R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible [...] One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.*

You can download R for free at https://cran.rstudio.com/
* Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
* Mac OS X: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/


### RStudio
To facilitate easy interfacing with R, we will use the RStudio IDE. You can learn more about RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/) *hint - it does so much more than what we will get to in class! This entire website and all the course materials were created through RStudio!*

You can download the free RStudio desktop version at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
